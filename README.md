In this project, I developed an advanced Todo App with features at enhancing thr user experience and providing functional task management. The features include task priority levels, search bar for filter task, theme toggle a completion animation when all tasks are done,
and simple dashboard. The goal was to create a dynamic and user friendly application where task will be added, modified, completed, deleted, and filtered. 

For priority levels, i created drop-down selection with three options: high, medium, and low. Tasks were then visually distinguished by color coding (e.g., red for high priority, yellow for medium, and green for low).

The search/filter functionality allowed users to quickly find tasks based on their name or other attributes.

The theme toggle feature enabled switching between light and dark modes to improve the user experience in different lighting environments.

A celebratory animation was triggered when all tasks were marked as completed, and the stats dashboard displayed the total number of tasks, completed tasks, and overdue tasks based on the current state of the app.

The challanges the i faced while creating this Todo App was managing the data task. Another challenge was correcting styling and functionakky for the theme toggle button, I also faced the difficulty in handling the task completion animation.

What i learned in the process of creating Todo App was valuable experience in javascript and DOM manipulation. i learned how to use the localstorage, which was necessary for the app functionality. I also learned how to enhance app by adding animations, filters, and dashboards. 

Feedback and ideas improvement there are several potential improvements and features that could be added. I could add the ability for users to set specific task deadlines and send reminders via notifications. 

To conclude, this project was a great learning experience that helped me improve my skills in development, especially in Javascript and CSS.
